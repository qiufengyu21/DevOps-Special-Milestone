In this milestone, we deployed checkbox using GitLab. It consisted of three stages, build, deploy to staging area and then deploy to production area manually.

Why GitLab?

The first advantage of using GitLab is that it is completely free for unlimited users and unlimited private repositories. There is paid version for enterprise as well but most of the features are already available in free tier.

Other features:

1. CI/CD: GitLab has in-built pipeline which can replace Jenkins. Hence, we can verify if the merge request will break our app or not.

2. Docker registry: GitLab has in built registry which stores docker images. Hence, rather than using public registry at hub.docker.com, we can use this feature.

3. 3rd party integration: If oen still wants to use 3rd party applications rather than using GitLab one, we can still use it as it supports integration for Jenkins, Slack, Google Cloud Platform, etc.

4. GitHub features: Most of the features which are present in GitHub are already present here. We have been using GitLab for past 3-4 weeks and we cannot find anything which is present in GitHub but not in GitLab (surely there must be few, but we are not missing it yet).
